WINDOWS INSTALLATION:
====================
This directory contains a Windows Batch file and a corresponding VBScript file which is used as a
utility to unzip files (since Windows has no native unzip functionality within Batch files). 

init.bat  - the script to run for installing the project.
unzip.vsb - utility to unzip files.

Notes and tips:
- the init.bat and unzip.vbs files are intended to be located in the root of the project.
- you might run into some issues while extracting some of the BRMS components because the 
  file path of the extracted file became greater than 255 chars (yet another windows 
  headache). By putting the project in a higher directory (c:\demo), the issue can be
  resolved.
